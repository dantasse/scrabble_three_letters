Pebble watch apps for all the three letter scrabble words.

The Word List
You'd think it might be simple to find a list of all three letter Scrabble words. You'd be wrong.
I tried to start with the TWL list (which I think is the same as the OWL or OTCWL), and which I found here (from TWL2014): http://www.isc.ro/nl/commands/lists.html
But I'm not sure it really was TWL2014; it might have been some mash between that and TWL2006 (the previous one). There were 66 three letter words added between the two lists (details here: http://scrabblepodcast.blogspot.com/2014/08/new-3-letter-words-in-ospd5.html) and some of those 66 were in the list I started with, and some weren't. So I tried to get the union of those two lists, and came up with 1130 words.

Any words I was in doubt about, I tried to consult the two online dictionaries: www.hasbro.com/scrabble-2/en_US/search.cfm#dictionary and http://www.merriam-webster.com/scrabble/finder/. However, theysometimes disagreed and were not up to date. Plus, I don't have a NASPA membership so I could not switch to "tournament mode" on the Merriam-Webster site and get all the words.

I got definitions from Wordnik, via python client:

and then heavily edited them, using both the online dictionaries I mentioned before and just a bunch of manual tweaks.
